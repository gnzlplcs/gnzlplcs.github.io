    <h2>Team Member Allocation</h2>
    <p>This project is a nifty little app designed to keep track of team members. It's got a neat
        trick up its sleeve - it stashes data right in your browser's <code>localStorage()</code>. Crafted with
        React JS, it takes advantage of the <code>create-react-app</code> feature. And that's not all - it's got
        React Router under the hood and is decked out in Bootstrap for that sleek look. Despite its
        humble nature, it's got some serious tech going on with the use of React Hooks like
        <code>useState()</code>, <code>useEffect()</code>, and <code>useContext()</code>.</p>

    <p>And guess what? It's live on Netlify, which is pretty cool because it supports routing. So,
        there you have it - a modest yet technologically robust project, ready to manage your teams!
